 * Common Collections

Rust’s standard library includes a number of very useful data structures called collections. Most other data types represent one specific value, but collections can contain multiple values. Unlike the built-in array and tuple types, the data these collections point to is stored on the heap, which means the amount of data does not need to be known at compile time and can grow or shrink as the program runs. Each kind of collection has different capabilities and costs, and choosing an appropriate one for your current situation is a skill you’ll develop over time.

 - A vector allows you to store a variable number of values next to each other.
 - A string is a collection of characters. We’ve mentioned the String type previously, but in this chapter we’ll talk about it in depth.
 - A hash map allows you to associate a value with a specific key. It’s a particular implementation of the more general data structure called a map.

  * Storing Lists of Values with Vectors

The first collection type we’ll look at is Vec<T>, also known as a vector. Vectors allow you to store more than one value in a single data structure that puts all the values next to each other in memory. Vectors can only store values of the same type. They are useful when you have a list of items, such as the lines of text in a file or the prices of items in a shopping cart.

```
 let v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
```
More often, you’ll create a Vec<T> with initial values and Rust will infer the type of value you want to store, so you rarely need to do this type annotation.

```
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
```

Because we’ve given initial i32 values, Rust can infer that the type of v is Vec<i32>, and the type annotation isn’t necessary.

Updating a Vector
To create a vector and then add elements to it, we can use the push method

```
    let mut v = Vec::new();

    v.push(5);
    v.push(6);
    v.push(7);
    v.push(8);
```

As with any variable, if we want to be able to change its value, we need to make it mutable using the mut keyword

Reading Elements of Vectors
There are two ways to reference a value stored in a vector: via indexing or by using the get method. In the following examples, we’ve annotated the types of the values that are returned from these functions for extra clarity.

```
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let third: &i32 = &v[2];
    println!("The third element is {third}");

    let third: Option<&i32> = v.get(2);
    match third {
        Some(third) => println!("The third element is {third}"),
        None => println!("There is no third element."),
    }
```

Note a few details here. We use the index value of 2 to get the third element because vectors are indexed by number, starting at zero. Using & and [] gives us a reference to the element at the index value. When we use the get method with the index passed as an argument, we get an Option<&T> that we can use with match.

let’s see what happens when we have a vector of five elements and then we try to access an element at index 100 with each technique

```
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let does_not_exist = &v[100];
    let does_not_exist = v.get(100);
```

When we run this code, the first [] method will cause the program to panic because it references a nonexistent element. This method is best used when you want your program to crash if there’s an attempt to access an element past the end of the vector.

When the get method is passed an index that is outside the vector, it returns None without panicking. You would use this method if accessing an element beyond the range of the vector may happen occasionally under normal circumstances.

When the program has a valid reference, the borrow checker enforces the ownership and borrowing rules (covered in Chapter 4) to ensure this reference and any other references to the contents of the vector remain valid. Recall the rule that states you can’t have mutable and immutable references in the same scope.

```
    let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let first = &v[0];

    v.push(6);

    println!("The first element is: {first}");
```

Compiling this code will result in this error:

```
$ cargo run
   Compiling collections v0.1.0 (file:///projects/collections)

error: could not compile `collections` (bin "collections") due to 1 previous error
```

The code in Listing 8-6 might look like it should work: why should a reference to the first element care about changes at the end of the vector? This error is due to the way vectors work: because vectors put the values next to each other in memory, adding a new element onto the end of the vector might require allocating new memory and copying the old elements to the new space, if there isn’t enough room to put all the elements next to each other where the vector is currently stored. In that case, the reference to the first element would be pointing to deallocated memory. The borrowing rules prevent programs from ending up in that situation.

* Iterating Over the Values in a Vector
To access each element in a vector in turn, we would iterate through all of the elements rather than use indices to access one at a time.

```
    let mut v = vec![100, 32, 57];
    for i in &mut v {
        *i += 50;
    }
```

To change the value that the mutable reference refers to, we have to use the * dereference operator to get to the value in i before we can use the += operator.

Iterating over a vector, whether immutably or mutably, is safe because of the borrow checker’s rules.

 * Using an Enum to Store Multiple Types
Vectors can only store values that are of the same type. This can be inconvenient; there are definitely use cases for needing to store a list of items of different types. Fortunately, the variants of an enum are defined under the same enum type, so when we need one type to represent elements of different types, we can define and use an enum!

```
    enum SpreadsheetCell {
        Int(i32),
        Float(f64),
        Text(String),
    }

    let row = vec![
        SpreadsheetCell::Int(3),
        SpreadsheetCell::Text(String::from("blue")),
        SpreadsheetCell::Float(10.12),
    ];
```

When the vector gets dropped, all of its contents are also dropped, meaning the integers it holds will be cleaned up. The borrow checker ensures that any references to contents of a vector are only used while the vector itself is valid.
